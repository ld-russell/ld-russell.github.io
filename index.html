<p>LinkedIn Learning (formerly known as Lynda.com) is an online learning platform available for free through the Port Moody Public Library.</p>

<p>With LinkedIn Learning, you have access to over 16,000 online video courses, including courses in other languages (English, French, German, Japanese, Spanish, Mandarin, and Portuguese).</p>

<h2>How to use LinkedIn Learning on your computer</h2>

<p>Log in with your Port Moody Public Library card number and PIN (last four digits of your phone number). To ensure that you are getting free access to this resource, go through the Library's link below so LinkedIn Learning knows that you are a Library member.</p>

<h2>How to use LinkedIn Learning on your phone or tablet</h2>

<p>Download the LinkedIn Learning app for Android and Apple. Open the app, tap "sign in", then select "Sign in with your library card". The library ID is portmoodylibrary.</p>

<p>Press "continue" and you will be asked to enter your library card number and PIN (last four digits of your phone number).</p>

<p>Note: You do not have to have a LinkedIn account to use this resource. Furthermore, LinkedIn Learning is not tied to your LinkedIn profile. Nothing you do on LinkedIn Learning will appear on your profile.</p>
